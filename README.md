# Klima Subgraph

The main subgraph that houses all of the data components indexed by a graph node.

## Local Installation

First, deploy a Graph node locally. The most straightforward option is to use
`docker-compose` from the [graph-node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/tree/master/docker#docker-compose) repo.
Make sure to update the `ethereum` environment variable of `graph-node` in `docker/docker-compose.yml` to `matic:https://polygon-rpc.com/`.

For information on getting started with a Graph Node see this link: https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

Install any needed packages.
```
npm i
```

Create the Klima subgraph.
```
npm run create-local
```

Finally deploy the subgraph and start indexing.
```
npm run deploy-local
```

## Local Navigation and Querying

After the subgraph is deployed, navigate to http://127.0.01:8000/subgraphs/name/name-of-subgraph. You can then create GraphQL queries and view the returned data.
