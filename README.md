The main subgraph that houses all of the data components indexed by a graph node.

## Local Installation

For information on getting started with a Graph Node see this link: https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

## Local Navigation and Querying

After the subgraph is deployed, navigate to http://127.0.01:8000/subgraphs/name/name-of-subgraph. You can then create GraphQL queries and view the returned data.
